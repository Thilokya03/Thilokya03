## 🚀 Projects

- [**Nano Processor**](https://github.com/adLahiru/Nano_Processor_v1)  
  Designed and implemented a 4-bit nano processor using VHDL and Tcl as part of a Computer Organization and Digital Design module.  
  This project involved building the processor's architecture, simulating its operation, and verifying functionality using testbenches. The experience strengthened my understanding of digital systems, hardware description languages, and FPGA workflows.

- [**Blood Bank Management System**](https://github.com/nadilHesara/iwb25-203-code-drift)  
  Collaborated with team Code Drift to develop a comprehensive web application for blood bank management, presented at an IEEE Computer Society competition.  
  The system streamlines donor registration, blood inventory tracking, and hospital requests. Built with JavaScript, Ballerina, CSS, and HTML, this project enhanced my full-stack development, teamwork, and software engineering skills.
